# LPG-detection-with-auto-cut-regulator
**Description**:-
Creating a gas leak detector with an automatic valve shutdown feature using a Wemos D1 Mini is a practical project for enhancing safety in environments prone to gas leaks. This IoT-based solution allows for remote monitoring and control, ensuring rapid response to potential hazards. Below is a high-level overview of how to develop this system:

Components Needed:

1. Wemos D1 Mini - A compact WiFi-capable microcontroller based on the ESP8266.
2. MQ Gas Sensor - For detecting various gases. MQ-2, MQ-5, or MQ-9 are suitable for detecting LPG, natural gas, and carbon monoxide.
3. Servo Motor - To mechanically turn the gas valve off.
4. Buzzer - For audible alerts.
5. LEDs - Visual indicators for system status.
6. Power Supply - To power the Wemos D1 Mini and peripherals.
7. Jumper Wires - For connections.
8. Zero PCB - For assembly.
